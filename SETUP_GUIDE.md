## 🚀 Expanding the Game

### Adding New Pieces:
1. Create new ability module in `src/Game/Abilities/`
2. Follow the pattern from `Pawn.lua` or `Knight.lua`
3. Define stats, passive, and active abilities

### Example - Adding a Bishop:
```lua
-- src/Game/Abilities/Bishop.lua
local Bishop = {}
Bishop.__index = Bishop

function Bishop.new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, Bishop)
    self.Name = "Bishop"
    self.Health = 80
    self.Attack = 15
    self.Cooldown = 6
    return self
end

function Bishop:UseAbility(board, targetTile)
    -- Diagonal healing beam
    -- Implementation here...
end

return Bishop
```

### Adding Visual Effects:
- Hook into TweenService for animations
- Add particle effects using Roblox's Attachment/ParticleEmitter
- Include sound effects via SoundService

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Roblox Compatibility:
- All scripts use proper Roblox services
- Client-server separation for security
- ModuleScripts return tables for organization
- LocalScripts handle UI, server validates actions

### Performance:
- Modular design for easy maintenance
- Efficient RemoteEvent usage
- Memory-conscious object management

### Security:
- Server-side ability validation
- Cooldown enforcement on server
- Move validation before execution

## 🎨 Customization

### UI Styling:
- Color schemes in RGB format
- Corner radius and stroke effects
- Gradient backgrounds
- Font: Gotham/GothamBold

### Game Balance:
- Adjust piece stats in ability modules
- Modify cooldown timers
- Change board size in Board.lua
- Add new damage formulas
